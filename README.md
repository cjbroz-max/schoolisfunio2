Hello this is a website where you can play on a emulator and stuff anyway enjoy
includes a ruffle emulator so far you can download the henrystickmangame.swf if you want to which is Breaking the Bank. You can import it into the ruffle emulator. and a nintendo ds emulator but you have to import your files into the emulator as of right now
might add a library of games soon for the ds but not yet

still work in progress and me used google to help me make this
